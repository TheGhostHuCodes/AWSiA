# Amazon Web Services in Action

My workspace containing code listings from ["Amazon Web Services in Action,
Second
Edition"](https://www.manning.com/books/amazon-web-services-in-action-second-edition),
by Michael Wittig and Andreas Wittig.

This book uses the AWS cli, AWS console, and CloudFormation to stand up
infrastructure. I chose to use [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to
reimplement some of these exercises.
